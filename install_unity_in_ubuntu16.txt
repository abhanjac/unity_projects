Go to this link:

https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/

Then scroll down and go to the last page (https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/page-2)

The latest release link will be there.

But be sure to use the debian package.

The package is also copied here in the parent folder of this text file.

Or you can do the following as mentioned in the link (https://askubuntu.com/questions/957991/how-can-i-install-unity-3d-game-engine-for-ubuntu)
to get the debian package and install it.

As well you want at least 15-20 GB free space on your HDD/SSD for this operation. Now that this all is out of the way do the following in a terminal:

sudo apt install gdebi
wget http://beta.unity3d.com/download/ee86734cf592/unity-editor_amd64-2017.2.0f3.deb
sudo gdebi unity-editor_amd64-2017.2.0f3.deb

Now the C# editor in unity is monoDevelop. This is already installed with the debian package installed earlier. 
But this needs to be activated in unity. 

So do the following (https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-to-install-unity-and-monodevelop-on-ubuntu-16-04-linux.485113/).
In the link mentioned above for this, there are instructions for installing monoDevelop as well. But we will not be needing that as it is already there.

To activate this monoDevelop editor:
Open unity -> Go to Edit -> Preferences -> External tools -> External script editor -> Click browse -> then go to this path /opt/Unity/MonoDevelop/bin -> choose MonoDevelop.exe


To remove unity use the following command:
sudo apt-get remove unity-editor -y
